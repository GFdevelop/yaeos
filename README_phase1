### YAEOS - Yet Another Educational Operating System ###

YAEOS is a project conceived by Professor Renzo Davoli, for didactic purpose, for his students of Operating System course at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna.
The core idea is to build an operating system starting only from a ARM7TDMI cpu emulator, called uARM (microAMR).

What you will find in this repository is a possible implementation proposed by the group "lso18az17" formed by:
- Fornari Francesco <francesco.fornari2@studio.unibo.it>
- Fulgaro Gabriele <gabriele.fulgaro@studio.unibo.it>
- Polverini Mattia <mattia.polverini@studio.unibo.it>

### REQUIREMENTS ###

- uARM (can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/mellotanica/uARM)
- GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain
- make
- tar, gzip, perl (used by make)

### HOW TO TEST IMPLEMENTATION ###

After downloading and extracting the project archive, just run "make p1test" in the command line to build up the project.
For more option run "make help".
After this step, a file name phase1 should have appeared in the project's root directory.
Open uARM, power on the emulator and under the setting menu select phase1 as uARM core file.
Open terminal, click run on uARM and wait for the magic!
